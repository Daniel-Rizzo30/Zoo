    Felidae, more formally known as cats, is a family of mammals in the order Carnivora. Felidae species 
    exhibit the most diverse fur pattern of all terrestrial carnivores. Cats have retractile claws, slender 
    muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite.
    They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. 
    Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest 
    habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain.
