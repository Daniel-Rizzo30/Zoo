    Adult walrus are characterised by prominent tusks and whiskers, and their 
    considerable bulk: adult males in the Pacific can weigh more than 2,000 
    kilograms (4,400 pounds)[3] and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size 
    only by the two species of elephant seals.[4] Walruses live mostly in 
    shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant amounts 
    of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat. 
    Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered 
    to be a "keystone species" in the Arctic marine regions.
