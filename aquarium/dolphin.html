    Dolphins are widespread. Most species prefer the warm waters of the tropic zones, 
    but some, like the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely 
    on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals such 
    as seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females 
    only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer 
    months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species 
    fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a 
    variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.
