    Manatees are herbivores and eat over 60 different freshwater and 
    saltwater plants. Manatees inhabit the shallow, marshy coastal areas 
    and rivers of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Amazon 
    basin, and West Africa. The main causes of death for manatees are 
    human-related issues, such as habitat destruction and human objects. 
    Their slow-moving, curious nature has led to violent collisions
    with propeller-driven boats and ships. Natural causes of death 
    include adverse temperatures, predation by crocodiles 
    on young, and disease.
