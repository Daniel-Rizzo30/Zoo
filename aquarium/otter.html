    Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most 
    striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, 
    and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp 
    claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular 
    tails. The 13 species range in adult size from 0.6 to 1.8 m (2.0 to 5.9 ft) 
    in length and 1 to 45 kg (2.2 to 99.2 lb) in weight. The Asian small-clawed 
    otter is the smallest otter species and the giant otter and sea otter are 
    the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected 
    by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps 
    them dry, warm, and somewhat buoyant under water.
