  <p>
    The cat is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat
    to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship
    and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries. The cat is
    similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and
    retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat
    communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well
    as cat-specific body language. Domestic cats can be found all over the world and were even worshiped in ancient
    Egypt. Cats learn to meow just to communicate with humans about what they want! These fiesty little creatures
    will rule you before you get the chance to rule them.
