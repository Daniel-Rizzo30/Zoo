    The lion is a large cat native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round
    ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
    have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult
    males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
    lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to
    hunt humans, the species typically does not. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more
    diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic
    period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been
    reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable
    on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.
    Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,
    habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. Lions are considered 'the King of the Jungle' because
    of their strength and lack of predators.
